# 1- TraCeR

# Assemble
# - takes fastq files of paired-end RNA-seq reads from a single-cell and reconstructs TCR sequences
tracer assemble [options] <phase_1> <cell> 

# Summarise
# takes a set of directories containing output from the assemble phase 
# (each directory represents a single cell) and summarises TCR recovery rates as well as generating clonotype networks.
tracer summarise [options] <autoimmune>


# Build
# creates new combinatorial recombinomes for species other than the inbuilt Human and Mouse.
tracer build <mouse> <TCR> <locus_name> <N_padding> <colour> <V_seqs> <J_seqs> <C_seqs> <D_seqs>
